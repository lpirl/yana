Blessings API Reference

Read The Readme First
=====================

This is the API documentation for the Blessings terminal library. Because
Blessings uses quite a bit of dynamism, you should `read the readme first`_, as
not all the useful stuff shows up in these autogenerated docs. However, if
you're looking for seldom-used keyword args or a peek at the internals, you're
in the right place.
