YANA
====

**Y**\ et **A**\ nother **N**\ otes **A**\ pp wants ease the management
of knowledge using
only a few mental concepts,
tools you know (e.g. your terminal and editor of choice)
and building on technology that will persist (i.e. human-readable files in
the file system).

However, it is rather a **personal prototype** than a product with batteries included.

Features
========

See table of contents of the `document describing the usage <USAGE.rst>`_.

To-Do's
=======

* tags (near future, mentally designed half way through)

  * can they be tagged themselves?

* connections

  * directed
  * labeled

  * but how to represent them?

    * using links in markup language?
    * using symlinks?
    * using IDs?
    * …?

  * can they be tagged?

* mappable to mind maps and vice versa

  * again: how?

Useless Trivia [1]_
===================

*YANA* emerged because of the dissatisfaction of the available personal
knowledge management tools.
For example,
bookmarking and re-reading Web sites is too verbose and
inefficient,
placing text files everywhere is too unstructured,
hosted solutions introduce dependencies and so on.

It is still an experiment and it remains unclear if the aspired concepts
are representable using the employed low-tech foundations…
